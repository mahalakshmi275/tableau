This Tableau dashboard provides a detailed analysis of real estate trends, with a focus on property prices across different bedroom counts, geographic locations (zip codes), and time-based revenue performance.

1. Avg Price per Bedroom:  
   The top-left bar chart presents the average property price based on the number of bedrooms (ranging from 0 to 6). Properties with 2 bedrooms have the highest average price, while properties with 0 bedrooms (likely studio apartments) have the lowest. Interestingly, prices donâ€™t always rise steadily with the number of bedrooms, suggesting that 2-bedroom properties might hit a sweet spot in demand, offering the best balance between size and affordability.

2. Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings:  
   The top-right table shows the distinct number of listings by bedroom count. One-bedroom properties are the most common, with 1,811 listings, while properties with 6 bedrooms are rare, with only 5 listings. This indicates that smaller homes (1-2 bedrooms) dominate the market, reflecting potential demand for affordable or smaller family homes.

3. Price per Zipcode (Map and Bar Chart):  
   A color-coded map (bottom left) and corresponding bar chart (bottom center) display property prices by zip code. The bar chart ranks zip codes by average price, showing that zip code 98109 has the highest prices, followed closely by 98112 and 98119. This highlights the geographic disparities in property values, with some zip codes commanding significantly higher prices, likely due to desirability or proximity to key areas.

4. Revenue for the Year:  
   The bottom-right line graph tracks revenue trends over the course of a year. It shows a steady increase, with some fluctuations throughout the months, reflecting stable growth in the real estate market, possibly influenced by seasonal demand.

Overall, the dashboard offers a clear and informative view of property prices, market distribution, and revenue trends, helping users identify key market patterns.
